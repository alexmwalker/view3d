# view3d
Renders any flat single-piece cover graphic into a 3d posable model.

## Basic HTML 

The basic HTML structure for each book graphic.

    <div class="book">
        <div class="cover">
            <img src="img/scrum1.png" alt="Scrum Novice to Ninja book" />
        </div>
    </div>

By default, books should render square and flat with a simple shadow. The .book class is the frame. The .cover class works to mask the IMG down to the front only.
